#We start our server block by indicating the port number and domain name 
#where our first project should be accessible. 
#We'll assume that you have a domain name for each:
server {
    listen 80;
    server_name week8.com www.week8.com;

#Next, we can tell Nginx not to worry if it can't find a favicon. 
#We will also point it to the location of our static files directory 
#where we collected our site's static elements:
    location = /favicon.ico { access_log off; log_not_found off; }
    location /static/ {
        root /home/jwang02/week8;
    }

#Next we can create a catch-all location block that will pass all additional 
#queries straight to our application. 
#We will include the uwsgi parameters found in the /etc/nginx/uwsgi_params 
#and pass the traffic to the socket that the uWSGI server sets up:
    location / {
        include         uwsgi_params;
        uwsgi_pass      unix:/run/uwsgi/week8.sock;
    }
}
