#We start our server block by indicating the port number and domain name where our first project should be 
#accessible. We'll assume that you have a domain name for each:
server {
    listen 80;
    server_name django_test.com www.django_test.com;
#Next, we can tell Nginx not to worry if it can't find a favicon. We will also point it to the location of our 
#static files directory where we collected our site's static elements:
    location = /favicon.ico { access_log off; log_not_found off; }
    location /static/ {
#MAKE SURE CHANGE THE NAME OF DIRECTORY THAT week8 PROJECT IS LOCATED ON YOUR SYSTEM
# 'jwang02' IS THE NAME OF MY ACCOUNT ON MY SYSTEM
        root /home/ubuntu/django_test;
    }
#Next we can create a catch-all location block that will pass all additional queries straight to our application. We 
#will include the uwsgi parameters found in the /etc/nginx/uwsgi_params and pass the traffic to the socket that the 
#uWSGI server sets up:
    location / {
        include uwsgi_params;
        uwsgi_pass unix:/run/uwsgi/django_test.sock;
    }
}
